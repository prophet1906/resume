    info:
      - role: Information Technology Consultant
        time: Nov. 2021 - Present
        company: SAP Labs, India, IT Platform Centre of Excellence
        details: |
          I act as a multiplier and technology expert, supporting IES
          development teams in their cloud journey. I help evaluate new
          offerings of the Business Technology Platform (BTP) and other
          cloud technologies to position them in the internal IES cloud
          strategy and drive technical decisions in SAP IES. I also provide
          reference patterns, core services, and libraries to simplify the
          cloud development experience. Part of my role also involves 
          implementing central applications to improve the productivity
          of all employees.
      - role: Developer 
        time: March 2019 - Oct. 2021
        company: SAP Labs, India, Master Data Integration
        details: |
          My most notable contribution to SAP was in Master Data Integration(MDI).
          My work involved working with functional programming languages like Scala, 
          OCaml, and ReasonML to deliver critical components of MDI. I also worked 
          as SRE and promoted DevOps culture. I also got experience with developing 
          bots and automating redundant tasks. All applications I developed during 
          my tenure with this team worked at scale(billions of requests). This team
          was a major learning milestone for me. I learned about formal verification 
          while developing critical components for this team.
      - role: Developer Associate, Scholar
        time: Sept. 2018 - March 2019
        company: SAP Labs, India, S/4 Hana Application Security
        details: |
          I joined this team for my 3rd Practical Phase as part of M.Tech at SAP.
          I was responsible for delivering a security reports dashboard. This 
          dashboard aggregated security vulnerabilities and other information for all 
          projects within SAP. This dashboard also provided all executives with a 
          birds-eye view of their products.
      - role: Research Fellow, Scholar
        time: June 2018 - Sept. 2018
        company: SAP SE, Germany, IT Platform Centre of Excellence
        details: |
          I created a prototype for internal team switching and connecting managers 
          with candidates in 2017. It was a cardboard prototype developed in my free 
          time to learn new technologies. The prototype went viral. The head of the 
          vocational training program appreciated the idea and offered me a fellowship 
          to stay in Germany for three months and productize this idea for global usage. 
          I was responsible for redeveloping the same application from scratch but with 
          quality as the core focus this time.
      - role: Developer Associate, Scholar
        time: April 2018 - May 2018
        company: SAP Labs, India, Build
        details: |
          I participated in a hackathon at SAP. The forcus of this hackathon was to
          create a prototype for disruptive ideas which can capture new customers, but
          are not high priority for product teams because of high initial investment.
          The ideas came from real product team backlog. I got selected to implement one
          of the ideas from SAP Build team. SAP Build was a UI prototyping and Low Code,
          No Code Platform which allowed users to drag and drop UI components connect to
          different backends and generate source code for SAPUI5 apps without writing any
          code. I was tasked with automatically generating source code for Android and iOS
          apps using existing interface. My team(total 4 members) successfully implemented
          and delivered the prototype and were runner up in the competition.
      - role: Developer Associate, Scholar
        time: Sept 2017 - April 2018
        company: SAP Concur, India, Service Innovation
        details: |
          I was responsible for creating a tool to automate configuration migration 
          for companies within the same industry. Most companies within a particular 
          industry use the same set of software with minor tweaks. This automation helped 
          save many consultant efforts and reduce the redundant job of manually feeding 
          configurations. I also developed a plugin(used machine learning) to detect 
          non-reimbursable items(alcohol,...) from any expense receipt in Concur's travel 
          and expense management system.
